# 🚀 Codex_Lab

A hackathon project powered by GitHub + OpenAI Codex.  
This repo is our experimental playground to build, test, and launch features rapidly with AI-assisted development.

## 🎯 Purpose

Codex_Lab is a collaborative environment where ideas are turned into code fast using Codex prompts, GitHub workflows, and real-time coding.  
Whether it's full-stack features, APIs, automation tools, or mini utilities — this is the lab where we experiment and ship.

## 🧩 Tech Stack (Planned or Used)

- 🧠 OpenAI Codex / GPT-4o
- 🖥️ Node.js / Express
- 🐍 Python (for scripts, automation)
- 🗂️ MongoDB / Firebase / SQLite (TBD)
- 🌐 HTML, CSS, JS, Bootstrap
- ⚙️ GitHub + Git CLI + VS Code / Cursor IDE
